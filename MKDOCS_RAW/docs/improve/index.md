 - The taxonomy data properties above phylum, aswell as the for the classyfire data are currently empty and will receive it's data in a future update.

## Planned future updates

 - With the help of catalogueoflife, get the complete taxonomy tree off mostly all compounds in the dataset.
 - With the help of classyfire(currently under maintenance), get the complete chemical classification off mostly all compounds in the dataset.
 - Further improve the ontology with input from chemists and biologists.
